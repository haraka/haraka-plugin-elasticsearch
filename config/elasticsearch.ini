; default ES index names are shown.
; Transactions include all the connection
; information and are "the good stuff." When a connection has transactions,
; the connection is not saved separately. The distinction is that a connection
; is stored when it has zero transactions. The connections index tends to
; be mostly noise (monitoring, blocked connections, bruteforce auth attempts,
; etc.) and for that reason, some choose not to store them at all.
